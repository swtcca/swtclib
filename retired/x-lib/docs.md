## Server

Server class connects jingtum with ws lib to keep long connection. It's packaged to `Remote` class, should not be used outside jingtum-lib.

## Remote

Main function class in jingtum-lib. It creates a handle with jingtum, makes request to jingtum, subscribes event to jingtum, ands gets info from jingtum.

### Remote(options)

options for setup a remote, options including

    {
    	server: 'wss://ts.jingtum.com:5020',
    	local_sign: false
    }

`server` is string for jingtum websocket server url, `local_sign` checks if jingtum-lib sign transaction in local, it will be implemented later.

### connect(callback)

Each remote object should connect jingtum first. Now jingtum should connect manual, only then you can send request to backend.
callback as callback(err, ret), err checks error info, ret is restul result.

### disconnect

Remote object can be disconnected manual, and no parameters are required.

### requestServerInfo

Create request object and get server info from jingtum, including

    {
        version: '0.29.60', //服务程序版本号
        ledgers: '6753-14393', //该服务缓存的账本区间
        node: 'n9LxdTZbjjQnuPiM5SgwPYQndfb64YHbmCp1mhsoch7uw5HQJ3k6', //节点公钥
        state: 'full   34:35:40' //服务器当前状态：full可提供服务状态；proposing验证节点状态
    }

`version` is currenct jingtum version; `ledgers` are complted ledgers in system; `node` is jingtum node id; `state` is currenct jingtum node state.

### requestLedgerClosed

Create request object and get last closed ledger in system.
return data include ledger_index, ledger_hash and so on.

    {
    	fee_base: 10,
    	ledger_hash: '326EF17272606D8DD72F96F6299E54839D76435DCEB6F68385D891105ABB0E6C',
    	ledger_index: 14402,
    	reserve_base: 10000000,
    	reserve_inc: 1000000,
    	txn_count: 0,
    	validated: '6753-14402'
    }

`fee_base` is current swt fee in each transaction. `ledger_hash` and `ledger_index` are last closed ledger height info. `reserve_base` and `reserve_in`c are reserve swt infomations. `txn_count` is transaction count in last closed ledger. `validated` is current validated ledgers in last cloed ledger.

### requestLedger(options)

options can be ledger index and ledger hash. If none is provided, then last closed ledger is returned.

    {
        accepted: true,
        ledger_hash: '32A1E3E58000183D5D50E9662133183DFA9BA695763B4D44B5FEDF71476A1DF1',
        ledger_index: '14468',
        parent_hash: '6CEBA5BC7EDDD3AD110F5F9933FE2301443A99BC7158DFF19C04AF5E7F5BABD3',
        close_time: '2016-Nov-26 14:43:10',
        total_coins: '600000000000000000'
    }

`accepted` marks the ledger is accepted. `ledger_hash` and `ledger_index` are ledger height informations. `parent_hash` is parent ledger hash. `close_time` is ledger closed time in UTC+8. `total_coins` is total swt in system.

### requestTx(options)
